      <h2>Hi! My Name is Lindsay.</h2>

      <p>I am a lifelong artist and animal lover.  I started painting pets because I wanted to give creative gifts to my friends and family that were personal and meaningful. I love getting to see photos of people's special family members, and hope that I can bring joy through my work. </p>
