        <p className="p1">I base my painting on one of your favorite photos of your pet. Please send me the photo you would like me to use, along with any other photos that might be a good reference for their markings, or personality. I love hearing about each special animal. </p>


        <p className="p2"> When the portrait is completed, I will send you an email with a digital photo of the painting and confirm your mailing address.  Your painting will be shipped in a mat so it's ready to frame. I will provide you with a tracking number.</p>
