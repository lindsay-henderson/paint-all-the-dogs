        <p className="p1">In order to capture you pet's personality as much as I can, I base my painting on one of your favorite photos of your pet. Send me the photo you would like me to use, along with any other photos that might be a good reference for their markings, or personality. I love hearing about each special animal. </p>


        <p className="p2"> When the portrait is completed, I will send you an email with a digital photo of the painting and confirm your mailing address.  Your painting will be shipped ready to frame in a while 11x14 matboard. I will provide you with a tracking number.</p>
